# py-oracle
_A multi-platform oracle app for solo RPGs in python and kivy._

GM-less roleplaying games often require to introduce random elements to make the story progress without player input. Oracles can come in various shapes, they basically consist on one or more random elements (dices, cards...) and a table that matches the results of the random draw with text prompts.  
While dice roller apps are quite common, virtual decks of card not so much. This project is born from my desire to have a convenient multi-purpose oracle app and to learn kivy for building android applications at the same time.

The main target will be android phones, but the libraries are multi-platform so it should be possible to build/run on different systems.

## Dependencies
- [kivy (2.0)](https://kivy.org)
